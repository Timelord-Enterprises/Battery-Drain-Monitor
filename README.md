# Battery Drain Monitor
This script was created out of frustration :)
Possible scenarios were that a customer complains that the battery drains to fast and during troubleshooting multiple technicians fail to log the battery percentage correctly and on time.  

This script writes the battery status, health, hardware configuration and battery percentage (every hour) to a .txt file on the desktop to monitor battery drain.

The interactive version gives you the option to run a 4K 10h stream of Gandalf the Gray nodding to the sax guy music.
 
# Dependencies

A laptop running macOS.
Terminal.app might need access to "System Events" to run certain code.

# How to run the script

Open Terminal.app (located in /Applications/Utilities or Cmd+Shift+U).
Before running the script you have to run "chmod u+x" or "chmod 777" on the bash script. 

After that you drag the script on the terminal window and the monitioring begins.
